To summarize, for a service to perform reliably, the following criteria needs to be met:
• A specific condition should be met—represented by an SLI.
• The condition should be met for a specific period within a specific target
range—represented by an SLO.
• If met, customers are happy, or else there will be consequences—represented by
an SLA.


SLAs are external promises made to the customer, while SLOs are internal promises that
need to be met so that SLAs are not violated
