29.You support a high-traffic web application with a microservice architecture. The home page of the application displays multiple widgets containing content such as the current weather, stock prices, and news headlines. The main serving thread makes a call to a dedicated microservice for each widget and then lays out the homepage for the user.

Users of the application are unhappy if this degraded mode occurs too frequently, but they would rather have some content served instead of no content at all. You want to set a Service Level Objective (SLO) to ensure that the user experience does not degrade too much. What Service Level Indicator (SLI) should you use to measure this?
*A. A quality SLI: the ratio of non-degraded responses to total responses.
B. An availability SLI: the ratio of healthy microservices to the total number of microservices.
C. A freshness SLI: the proportion of widgets that have been updated within the last 10 minutes.
D. A latency SLI: the ratio of microservice calls that complete in under 100 ms to the total number of microservice calls.

30.You support a multi-region web service running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) behind a Global HTTP/S Cloud Load Balancer (CLB). For legacy reasons, user requests first go through a third-party Content Delivery Network (CDN), which then routes traffic to the CLB. You have already implemented an availability
Service Level Indicator (SLI) at the CLB level. However, you want to increase coverage in case of a potential load balancer misconfiguration, CDN failure, or other global networking catastrophe. Where should you measure this new SLI? (Choose two.)
A. Your application servers' logs.
*B. Instrumentation coded directly in the client.
C. Metrics exported from the application servers.
D. GKE health checks for your application servers.
*E. A synthetic client that periodically sends simulated user requests.

Topic: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/adopting-slos#choosing_a_measurement_method

Note: as there is an SLI already configured at LB level and they want to increase the coverage then I we need SLI which will detect CDN/LB failures as well.
running health checks at application/server level wont cover this.
so according to me option B & E are correct which are outside of the GCP infra, which give more coverage and resembles the use behavior
